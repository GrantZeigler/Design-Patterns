# Grant Zeigler - Design patterns


## Design Pattern 1: Bridge

### Problem:
This is used in situations when the abstractiona and the implementation need to be developed separately. Can also be used when the program only needes to access one and not the other.

### Solution: 
The solution is to create a "bridge" between the implementation and the abstraction. Doing this will allow for loose coupling between the abstraction and the implementation.


### Consequences: 
* Decoupling interface and implementation - Allows for the implementation to be changed or switched at runtime. Also allows for
* Improved extensibility - gain the ability to extend the implementationa and the abstraction indepentently, allowing for more specialized code 
* Hiding implementation details from clients - Clients won't be able to access data that they should not be able to acess


## Design Pattern 2: Decorator

### Problem:
Used when you want to add responsibilities to specific objects and not the whole class.

### Solution:


### Consequences:
